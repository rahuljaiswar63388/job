                    <p>
                        Natural cosmetics are suitable for all skin types. No matter if you are dark or fair, you will
                        find
                        natural cosmetics like foundation, eye shadow, and lipstick which are approtriate irrespective
                        of
                        your skin tone. Women with oily or sensitive skin can use them and never have to worry about
                        degrading their skin condition. Coal tar-derived colors are used extensively in cosmetics, Coal
                        tar
                        is recognized as a human carcinogen and the main concern with individual coal tar a
                        color(whether
                        produced from coal tar or synthetically) is they can cause canser. But natural colors that are
                        obtained from herbs are safer.

                        Natural cosmetics may still be a new type in the beauty industry but htey already offer a
                        variety of
                        beauty products for all make up crazy people out there to choose from. One will find a variety

                    <h2 class="heads">Fits your budget</h2>
                    <p>
                        Natural cosmetics are not that expensive. In fact, some of these products are morer affordable
                        than
                        synthetic ones. They are offerd at discounted prices and are sold for a cheap price during
                        sales.
                        Just need to survey enough to look for grat deals. An estimate of WHO demonstrates about 80% of
                        wrld
                        population depends on natural products for their health care, because of side effects inflicted
                        and
                        rising cost of mordrn medicine. World Health Organization currently trecommends and encourages
                        traditional herbel cures in natural health care programs as these drugs are easily available at
                        low
                        cost and are comparatively safe.

                    <h2 class="heads">Not tested on animals</h2>
                    <p>Some cosmetics are initially tested to animals to ensure that they are safe and effective to use
                        fir
                        human. However, natural cosmetics need not be tested on animals. These natural formulations are
                        tested by experts in laboratories using state of the art equipment with no animals involved.</p>
                    <hr>

                    <h2 class="heads">No side effects</h2>
                    <p>
                        The synthetic beauty products can irritate your skin, and cause pimples. They might block your
                        pores
                        and make your skin dry or oily. With natural cosmetics, one need worry about these. The natural
                        ingredients used assure no side effects; one can apply thm anytime, anywhere. For example herbel
                        cosmetics are free from parabens that are the most widely used preservative in cosmetics and can
                        penetrate the skin. And are suspected of interfering with hormone function (endrocrine
                        disruption).

                    <h2 class="heads">Cosmeceuticals</h2>
                    <p>
                        'Cosmeceuticals' is fastest growing segment of the beauty industry. Cosmeceuticals are
                        cosmetic-pharmaceutical products intended to improve the health and beauty of the skin by
                        providing
                        a specific result, ranging from acne-control and anti-wrinkle effect, to sun protection. The
                        concept
                        discovered by Dr. Albert Klingman states that "The Cosmeceuticals are topical agent that are
                        distributed across board spectrum of matrials, lying somewhere between pure cosmetics (lipstick
                        and
                        rouge) and pure grug (antibiotics, corticosteroids)."
